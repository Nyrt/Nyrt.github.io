Bio
</h2>

<p>
I am a Computer Science and Music double major at Tufts University, currently in my third year. I play the bassoon, unicycle, fence and compose electronic music. I am very interested in machine learning, audio synthesis, and game development, and hopefully will eventually be able to combine them into something neat.
